# Final Project

An exercise to put to practice software development teamwork, subsystem communication, containers, deployment, and CI/CD pipelines. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

This project is a continuation of our previous one, and it hopes to expand on it with a better api that allows more calls and a smoother front-end.
